      <div class="about">
        <p id="about2">ABOUT THE PROGRAM</p> <br> SU-CASA is a community arts engagement program that places artists in residence at senior centers <br> across Brooklyn. SU-CASA artists engage older adults in an art project or series of cultural
        programs over <br>the course of
        the residency. Each residency also includes a public program component â€“ exhibits, read- <br> ings, performances, open houses or other cultural events open to the surrounding community.<br>

        <p id="about3">This initiative seeks to connect artists with older adults to positively impact the well- <br>being of older adults through direct engagement in arts-based activities. Each senior <br>center is unique and offers access to
          different types of spaces and
          resources. Prior to <br>the beginning of their residency, SU-CASA artists will collaborate with the administrators <br>of their
          assigned senior center to further refine project goals and coordinate a sche- <br>dule for residency
          activities and use of facilities. <br><br>SU-CASA supports artists who are sensitive to the needs of older adults and who are <br>interested in engaging their communities. Brooklyn Arts Council will only accept applic- <br>ations from
          individual artists seeking residencies at participating senior centers <br>in Brooklyn.
          <br><br>Individual artists-in-residence receive a stipend of $4,500, an additional $1,000 materials <br>
          /supplies budget, and access to materials and supplies from Materials for the Arts. <br>Individual artists can apply directly to participate in the
          program without a <br>fiscal sponsor. Artists may apply for up to two SU-CASA residencies.
